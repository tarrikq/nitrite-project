## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r DataImport}
  file_list <- list.files(pattern = ".csv")
  nitrite <- read.csv("nitrite_data.csv")
  nitrite <- nitrite[ 2:79, 1:9]
  nitrite[is.na(nitrite)] = 0
	attach(nitrite)
#Must do the following if x is not a number: 
#xFactor<-as.factor(x)
#is.factor(xFactor)
	colnames(nitrite) <- c("Date", "Peak", "Date of peak", "Date to below 10ppb", "bin", "Filter change date", "days from peak to below 10ppb", "Days from begn to 10 ppb", "Days from changout to peak")
	


```

```{splitting into individual years}
nitrite_2019 <- nitrite[seq(1, nrow(nitrite), by=3), ]
nitrite_2020 <- nitrite[seq(2, nrow(nitrite), by=3), ]
nitrite_2021 <- nitrite[seq(3, nrow(nitrite), by=3), ]

```

## Boxplot of data

Boxplot included below.

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}

	boxplot(nitrite_2020$Peak~bin, col=rainbow(4),
		main = "Peak nitrite for each season",
        xlab = "Season",
        ylab = "Concentration")
        
        
```

## Note that the `echo = TRUE` parameter was added to the code chunk to keep printing of the R code that generated the plot.
