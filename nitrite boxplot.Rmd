## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r DataImport}
  file_list <- list.files(pattern = ".csv")
  nitrite <- read.csv("nitrite_data.csv")
  nitrite <- nitrite[ 2:79, 1:9]
  nitrite[is.na(nitrite)] = 0
	attach(nitrite)
#Must do the following if x is not a number: 
#xFactor<-as.factor(x)
#is.factor(xFactor)
	colnames(nitrite) <- c("Date", "Peak", "Date of peak", "Date to below 10ppb", "season", "Filter change date", "days from peak to below 10ppb", "Days from begn to 10 ppb", "Days from changout to peak")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r splitting into individual years}
nitrite_2019 <- nitrite[seq(3, nrow(nitrite), by=3), ]
nitrite_2020 <- nitrite[seq(1, nrow(nitrite), by=3), ]
nitrite_2021 <- nitrite[seq(2, nrow(nitrite), by=3), ]

nitrite_2019$season <- as.factor(nitrite_2019$season)
nitrite_2020$season <- as.factor(nitrite_2020$season)
nitrite_2021$season <- as.factor(nitrite_2021$season)
nitrite_2019$Peak <- as.numeric(nitrite_2019$Peak)
nitrite_2020$Peak <- as.numeric(nitrite_2020$Peak)
nitrite_2021$Peak <- as.numeric(nitrite_2021$Peak)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}


boxplot(nitrite_2019$Peak~nitrite_2019$season, col=rainbow(4),
        main = "Nitrite peaks in 2019 with respect to last filter changeout",
           xlab = "Season of last filter changout",
           ylab = "nitrite peak concentration (ug/l)")
        
boxplot(nitrite_2020$Peak~nitrite_2020$season, col=rainbow(4),
        main = "Nitrite peaks in 2020 with respect to last filter changeout",
           xlab = "Season of last filter changout",
           ylab = "nitrite peak concentration (ug/l)")

boxplot(nitrite_2021$Peak~nitrite_2021$season, col=rainbow(4),
        main = "Nitrite peaks in 2021 with respect to last filter changeout",
           xlab = "Season of last filter changout",
           ylab = "nitrite peak concentration (ug/l)")
        
```
